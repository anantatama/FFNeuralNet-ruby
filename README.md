# FFNeuralNet-ruby
One of my first ruby program.

This program was made during my first month of learning ruby, just a simple feed forward neural network with no optimization used.
The objective of this little project is to make me get used to ruby syntax, dont expect good result or clean code hahaha but i really learn a lot from this project.

Todo:
If i have spare time will add an optimization algorithm, maybe backpropagation or genetic algorithm.
